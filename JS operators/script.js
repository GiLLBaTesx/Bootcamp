// ESSAY PART:
// 1.What is the difference between a comparison operator and an assignment operator?
//  A: comparison operators only evaluate the value between element but does not change or alters the value while assignment operators change the value depending on the operator used.

// 2.What is a Boolean? What does it represent?
// A: Boolean is a tru/false statement. 

// 3.How is the += operator different than + operator?
// A: += refers to changing the value permanently, while + only changes the value for that certain operation it is called.


/*Code Part

1.Set two variables equal to two different numbers. Use a comparison operator to compare these two variables. Change one of their values by using the +=, -=, *=, or /= operator. Then, compare their values again.*/
/*
2.Try out the <= and >= operators.

3.Try to use the !== operator.*/
